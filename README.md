This project follows Clean Architecture principles with BLoC state management. It consists of Data, Domain, and Presentation layers.

(The development of this project follows a Git branching model from the master branch there's the home branch)
# Architecture
Clean Architecture

- Data Layer: Handles data operations.
- Domain Layer: Contains business logic and use cases.
- Presentation Layer: Manages UI logic and interactions.
- BLoC Pattern with Cubit

Utilizes BLoC for business logic and Cubit for state management.

# Bug Description
There is a known bug in the project where the UI is not rebuilding as expected.

Despite implementing selected variations and employing BLoC/Cubit for state management, the issue persists. As of this README update, the bug is yet to be resolved.
# Work in Progress
While the project has made progress in implementing Clean Architecture and BLoC/Cubit for state management, there are areas that can be improved. Due to time constraints, not all potential enhancements have been addressed. Final exams are currently the priority, and as such, some refinements will be deferred until after this period.
# Next Steps
Bug Fixing: Resolve UI rebuilding issue.
Code Refactoring: Enhance code quality.
Documentation: Improve understanding.
Optimizations: Implement performance improvements.
Additional Features: (If time permits) Add constants and styles.
